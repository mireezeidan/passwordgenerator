#Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to generate a password containing a number, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and special characters. 

#My Experience
My experience creating this webpage was a bit challenging due to it being purely JavaScript. Overall I found it to be very helpful in helping me begin to understand the structure and the way JavaScript code is written.
